Obviously the Visual Studio Code code editor: we download it

C/C++ compiler (in this case MinGW): we download it

Install extension for Visual Studio Code: C/C++ (Format for C/C++)

Install extension for Visual Studio Code: Code Runner

Once we have the 2 extensions installed and the compiler we go to the .c file and right click on it and select the run code option and right click to execute the .c file
